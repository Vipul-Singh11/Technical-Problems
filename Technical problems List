Q.1. A supermarket wants to build a system to calculate the total bill for each customer who buys multiple items. The number of items a customer buys is unknown in advance.
The system should:
1.Ask the customer for the number of items they wish to buy.
2.For each item, ask for the item price.
oop (choose the appropriate type) to read all item prices.
4.Finally, display the total amount to be paid by the customer.
Use proper loop logic to handle the dynamic number of items.
Note :
 - Use a for loop if the number of items is fixed at the start.
Sample Input :
Enter number of items: 4  
Enter price of item 1: 50  
Enter price of item 2: 30  
Enter price of item 3: 20  
Enter price of item 4: 100  
Sample Output :
Total bill: 200

Q.2. At the end of the day, your task is to sort these temperature readings in ascending order to generate a report showing how the temperature varied during the day from the lowest to the highest.
However, due to a legacy system limitation, you're required to use the Bubble Sort algorithm to perform the sorting.
Write a Java program that:
1.Accepts an array of temperature readings.
2.Sorts the array using Bubble Sort.
3.Displays the sorted readings.
Sample Test Case 01 :
Input:  {30, 25, 30, 20, 25}
Output: {20, 25, 25, 30, 30}
Sample test case 02 :
Input:  {32, 28, 35, 30, 25}
Output: {25, 28, 30, 32, 35}
