Q.1. A supermarket wants to build a system to calculate the total bill for each customer who buys multiple items. The number of items a customer buys is unknown in advance.
The system should:
1.Ask the customer for the number of items they wish to buy.
2.For each item, ask for the item price.
oop (choose the appropriate type) to read all item prices.
4.Finally, display the total amount to be paid by the customer.
Use proper loop logic to handle the dynamic number of items.
Note :
 - Use a for loop if the number of items is fixed at the start.
Sample Input :
Enter number of items: 4  
Enter price of item 1: 50  
Enter price of item 2: 30  
Enter price of item 3: 20  
Enter price of item 4: 100  
Sample Output :
Total bill: 200

Q.2. At the end of the day, your task is to sort these temperature readings in ascending order to generate a report showing how the temperature varied during the day from the lowest to the highest.
However, due to a legacy system limitation, you're required to use the Bubble Sort algorithm to perform the sorting.
Write a Java program that:
1.Accepts an array of temperature readings.
2.Sorts the array using Bubble Sort.
3.Displays the sorted readings.
Sample Test Case 01 :
Input:  {30, 25, 30, 20, 25}
Output: {20, 25, 25, 30, 30}
Sample test case 02 :

Q.3. You're building a Hospital Queue Management System. Every patient who enters the hospital is added to a queue implemented using a singly linked list. Each node in the list stores the patient's name and token number.
At any given time, the admin wants to check how many patients are currently waiting in the queue.
Your task is to write a Java program that calculates the total number of patients in the queue using a singly linked list.
Test Case 01 :
Input:
Patients: ["John", "Priya", "Ahmed", "Li", "Fatima"]
Output:
Total patients in queue: 5
Test Case 02 :
Patients: []   
Output :
Total patients in queue: 0

Q.4. A cybersecurity firm has developed a login system where users must enter a "reverse password" as an added layer of security.
Each user's original password is securely stored.
During login, users must enter their password in reverse.
The system will reverse the input again and compare it with the stored original password to validate access.
Write a Java program that:
1.Takes the original password (stored value).
2.Takes user-entered reversed password (during login).
3.Reverses the user input.
4.Compares it with the stored password.
5.Displays login success/failure based on the match
Sample Input :
Stored Password: JavaSecure123
User Input:     321eruceSavaJ
Sample output :
Login Successful!

Q.6. A railway coach yard is used to temporarily rearrange coaches before forming a train. Due to space and track design, coaches can only enter and leave from one end — this works like a stack (LIFO).
Your task is to simulate this yard system with the following conditions:
The yard can hold a maximum of 5 coaches at any time.
When a passenger express train is being formed, priority coaches (like AC First Class) must be added first.
You should not allow two identical coach IDs in the stack (i.e., no duplicates).
If the current top coach is a freight coach (F###), you must not add a passenger coach (P###) on top of it.
Implement the following operations:
push(coachID) → adds the coach after checking rules
pop() → removes the top coach
peek() → shows the top coach
display() → show stack from top to bottom

Q.7. A washing machine works on the principle of Fuzzy System, the weight of clothes put inside it for washing is uncertain But based on weight measured by sensors, it decides time and water level which can be changed by menus given on the machine control area.  
For low level water, the time estimate is 25 minutes, where approximately weight is between 2000 grams or any nonzero positive number below that.
For medium level water, the time estimate is 35 minutes, where approximately weight is between 2001 grams and 4000 grams.
For high level water, the time estimate is 45 minutes, where approximately weight is above 4000 grams.
Assume the capacity of machine is maximum 7000 grams
Where approximately weight is zero, time estimate is 0 minutes.
Write a function which takes a numeric weight in the range [0,7000] as input and produces estimated time as output is: “OVERLOADED”, and for all other inputs, the output statement is
“INVALID INPUT”.
Input should be in the form of integer value –
Output must have the following format –
Time Estimated: Minutes
Test Case :

2000
Output value
Time Estimated: 25 minutes

Q.20. Stephan is a vampire. And he is fighting with his brother Damon. Vampires get energy from human bloods, so they need to feed on human blood, killing the human beings. Stephan is also less inhuman, so he will like to take less life in his hand. Now all the people’s blood has some power, which increases the powers of the Vampire. Stephan just needs to be more powerful than Damon, killing the least human possible. Tell the total power Stephan will have after drinking the bloods before the battle.
Note : Damon is a beast, so no human being will be left after Damon drinks everyone’s blood. But Stephan always comes early in the town.
Input Format:
First line with the number of people in the town, n.
Second line with a string with n characters, denoting the one digit power in every blood.
